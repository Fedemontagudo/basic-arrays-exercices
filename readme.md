## Basic Array exercices for JS

I found this exercice browsing on internet, I have decided to give this challenges a try. Since JS is realy based on Array methods, is fundamental learning how to apply this knowledge on my daily basis. On this exercice methods like filter, map, sort and reduce will be practice. On some cases the exercice demands to create an array of objects from an aray of strings, other times, the oposite. I'm uploading the code to have the solutions somewhere.
